Personal project where I put in practise what I learnt in my FP studies.

This is an app that helps you to manage the resources of an enterprise. 

It's aimed to have a better control on the management of the employees and the IT material of an enterprise.

It consits of three pages: log in, dashboard of information, register new material and make changes.

I've used MySQL for the database that is managed with java. 

In the backend I used java. There are three layers: repository, services and controllers.

I did Unit Test to have a better control of the code.

In the frontend I used plain javascript. I created ajax requests to get and to send the information.

For the css I used some free templates in bootstrap (link in the code) that I've slightly modified in order to achive the results I wanted.
